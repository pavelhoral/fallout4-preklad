1
00:00:01,613 --> 00:00:03,218
I've lost Shaun

2
00:00:03,927 --> 00:00:05,323
all over again

3
00:00:07,095 --> 00:00:08,675
I close my eyes

4
00:00:08,696 --> 00:00:10,853
I see my life before all of this

5
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:12,977
before the bombs

6
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,423
everything can change in an instant

7
00:00:16,444 --> 00:00:18,892
and the future you plan for yourself shifts

8
00:00:19,313 --> 00:00:20,727
whether or not you're ready

9
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:24,008
at some point

10
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,735
it happens to all of us

11
00:00:27,978 --> 00:00:30,946
this was not the world I wanted

12
00:00:32,122 --> 00:00:34,220
but it was the one I found myself in

13
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:37,367
the Commonwealth

14
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:39,243
my home

15
00:00:40,235 --> 00:00:42,689
ripped apart and put back together

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,289
I thought, I hoped I could find my family

17
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,443
cheat time make us whole again

18
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:52,391
the way we were

19
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:57,178
but now I know

20
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,521
I know I can't go back

21
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:01,522
I know the world has changed

22
00:01:01,793 --> 00:01:03,748
that the road ahead will be hard

23
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,165
but this time I'm ready

24
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:11,492
because I know war

25
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:15,201
war never changes
