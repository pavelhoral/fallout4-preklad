1
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:52,110
I've lost Shawn all over
again I close my eyes I see my life

2
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,330
before all of this before the bombs

3
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,789
everything can change in an instant and

4
00:01:54,330 --> 00:02:00,810
the future you plan for yourself shifts

5
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,860
whether or not you're ready at some

6
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,420
point

7
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,420
it happens to all of us

8
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:13,730
this wasn't the world I wanted but

9
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:17,970
it was the one I found myself in

10
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:21,630
the Commonwealth my home

11
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:25,290
ripped apart and put back together

12
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:28,940
I thought I hoped I could find my family

13
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,940
cheat time make us whole again

14
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:40,000
we were but now I know I know I can't go

15
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:43,540
back I know the world has changed and

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,860
that the road ahead will be hard this

17
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,859
time I'm ready

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,650
because I know war

19
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,260
never changes
