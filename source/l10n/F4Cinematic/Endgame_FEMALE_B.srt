1
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:51,919
I've lost Sean all
over again I closed my eyes I see my

2
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,480
life before all of this before the bombs

3
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,700
everything can change in an instant in

4
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,690
the future you plan for yourself shifts

5
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,800
whether or not you're ready at some

6
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,179
point

7
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,179
it happens to all of us

8
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:13,680
this was not the world I wanted

9
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:18,010
but it was the one I found myself in

10
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,540
the common wolf my home

11
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:25,379
ripped apart and put back together

12
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,269
I thought by I hoped I could find my

13
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:30,090
family

14
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:36,569
sheep time make us whole again the way

15
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:40,470
we were but now I know I know I can't go

16
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:42,780
back I know the world has changed the

17
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,400
road ahead will be hard

18
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,400
this time I'm ready

19
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,090
because I know

20
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,630
or never changes
