1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:16,270
I can feel it wash over me the heat the

2
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:21,369
force radiation the fear it's the end of

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:25,238
the world all over again I close my eyes

4
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:27,390
I see my life before all of this before

5
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:30,040
the bombs

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,200
everything can change in an instant and

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,399
the future you plan for yourself shifts

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,530
whether or not you're ready

9
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:43,260
at some point

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:45,260
it happens to all of us this was not the

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,489
world I wanted

12
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:51,300
but it was the one I found myself in the

13
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:53,390
common law

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,989
my home

15
00:00:53,390 --> 00:01:00,860
ripped apart and put back together

16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:02,060
I thought my I hoped I could find my

17
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,570
family

18
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:11,150
she'd time make us whole again the way

19
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:14,149
we were but now I know I know

20
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:18,760
I can't go back I know the world has

21
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,760
changed the road ahead will be hard

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,210
because I know or

23
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:47,340
war never changes

24
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:51,919
I've lost Sean all
over again I closed my eyes I see my

25
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,480
life before all of this before the bombs

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,700
everything can change in an instant in

27
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,690
the future you plan for yourself shifts

28
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,800
whether or not you're ready at some

29
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,179
point

30
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,179
it happens to all of us

31
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:13,680
this was not the world I wanted

32
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:18,010
but it was the one I found myself in

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,540
the common wolf my home

34
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:25,379
ripped apart and put back together

35
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,269
I thought by I hoped I could find my

36
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:30,090
family

37
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:36,569
sheep time make us whole again the way

38
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:40,470
we were but now I know I know I can't go

39
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:42,780
back I know the world has changed the

40
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,400
road ahead will be hard

41
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,400
this time I'm ready

42
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,090
because I know

43
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,630
or never changes
