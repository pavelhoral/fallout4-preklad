1
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:18,089
following total atomic annihilation

1
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:21,868
the rebuilding of this great nation of

1
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:23,899
ours may fall to you that's why we at

1
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:26,698
Walt Tech have prepared these

1
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:29,698
educational materials for you to better

that make you special now let's discuss

1
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:43,229
the uses of agility a nuclear blast and

1
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:47,479
the subsequent fallout will have many

1
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:50,549
adverse effects on life as we know it

1
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:53,789
intensive prolonged radiation exposure

1
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:56,819
may transform those above ground into

1
00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:00,269
decrepit rotting beings that have lost

1
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,689
their ability to reason they will likely

1
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:07,320
be without common manners and quick to

1
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:11,700
anger you must learn to make the most of

1
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:15,328
available firearms but enthusiasm will

1
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,420
only take you so far now let's try that

1
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:19,828
again and remember that with your

1
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,740
impressive agility

1
00:01:19,828 --> 00:01:24,739
you can act more decisively in glance

1
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:32,638
see it's a snap

1
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:35,868
agility can also help you out in

1
00:01:32,638 --> 00:01:35,868
difficult moments

1
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:44,849
but why place yourself under undue

1
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:48,040
stress instead try a simpler route

1
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:51,729
taking the quieter approach is always

1
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:57,640
worth consideration your agility can

1
00:01:51,730 --> 00:02:01,719
turn a sneak attack into a complete

1
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:09,909
tactical move keep in mind others may

1
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:12,579
have the same bright idea your agility

1
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:15,789
will help you move through the wasteland

1
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:18,370
with ease and yield other benefits like

1
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:20,650
assaulting an unsuspecting dreamer for

1
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,590
the king in hastily reloading your

1
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,240
firearms by piling on damage to

1
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,210
additional targets when the firm
