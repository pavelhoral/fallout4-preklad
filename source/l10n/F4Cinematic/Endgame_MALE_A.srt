1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:16,020
I can feel it wash over me the heat of

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:21,270
force the radiation of fear it's the end

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:24,020
of the world all over again I close my

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,420
eyes I see my life before all of this

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,830
before the bombs

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,200
everything can change in an instant and

7
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:35,489
the future you plan for yourself shifts

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,560
whether or not you're ready

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:42,720
at some point

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:45,430
it happens to all of us this wasn't the

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:49,510
world I wanted but

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:51,489
it was the one I found myself in the

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,430
cunt

14
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:56,959
my home

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:00,860
ripped apart and put back together

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,519
I thought I hoped I could find my family

17
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:11,750
cheap time make us whole again the way

18
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:14,590
we were but now I know I know I can't go

19
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:18,380
back and I know the world has changed

20
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:22,329
but the road ahead will be hard

21
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,329
this time I'm ready

22
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,409
because I know

23
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:47,600
never changes

24
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:52,110
I've lost Shawn all over
again I close my eyes I see my life

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,330
before all of this before the bombs

26
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,789
everything can change in an instant and

27
00:01:54,330 --> 00:02:00,810
the future you plan for yourself shifts

28
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,860
whether or not you're ready at some

29
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,420
point

30
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,420
it happens to all of us

31
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:13,730
this wasn't the world I wanted but

32
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:17,970
it was the one I found myself in

33
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:21,630
the Commonwealth my home

34
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:25,290
ripped apart and put back together

35
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:28,940
I thought I hoped I could find my family

36
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,940
cheat time make us whole again

37
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:40,000
we were but now I know I know I can't go

38
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:43,540
back I know the world has changed and

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,860
that the road ahead will be hard this

40
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,859
time I'm ready

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,650
because I know war

42
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,260
never changes
