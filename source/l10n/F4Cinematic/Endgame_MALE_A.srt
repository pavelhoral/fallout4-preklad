1
00:00:04,039 --> 00:00:06,242
I can feel it wash over me

2
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:11,656
the heat, the force, the radiation

3
00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:14,171
the fear

4
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:16,929
it's the end of the world

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,346
all over again

6
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:22,075
I close my eyes

7
00:00:22,096 --> 00:00:24,253
I see my life before all of this

8
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:26,377
before the bombs

9
00:00:27,714 --> 00:00:29,823
everything can change in an instant

10
00:00:29,852 --> 00:00:32,300
and the future you plan for yourself shifts

11
00:00:32,753 --> 00:00:34,167
whether or not you're ready

12
00:00:35,706 --> 00:00:37,448
at some point

13
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,175
it happens to all of us

14
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:44,346
this was not the world I wanted

15
00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:47,620
but it was the one I found myself in

16
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:50,767
the Commonwealth

17
00:00:51,537 --> 00:00:52,643
my home

18
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:56,089
ripped apart and put back together

19
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,757
I thought, I hoped I could find my family

20
00:01:00,778 --> 00:01:02,911
cheat time make us whole again

21
00:01:04,169 --> 00:01:05,900
the way we were

22
00:01:07,948 --> 00:01:10,578
but now I know

23
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,921
I know I can't go back

24
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:14,922
I know the world has changed

25
00:01:14,943 --> 00:01:16,898
that the road ahead will be hard

26
00:01:18,456 --> 00:01:20,456
but this time I'm ready

27
00:01:22,585 --> 00:01:24,791
because I know war

28
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:29,296
war never changes
