      <Source>A new case from Valentine's Detective Agency leads you on a search for a young woman and a secret colony of synths. Travel off the coast of Maine to the mysterious island of Far Harbor, where higher levels of radiation have created a more feral world.  Navigate through the growing conflict between the synths, the Children of Atom, and the local townspeople. Will you work towards bringing peace to Far Harbor, and at what cost? Far Harbor features the largest land mass for an add-on that we've ever created, filled with new faction quests, settlements, lethal creatures and dungeons. Become more powerful with new, higher-level armor and weapons.  (Quest "Far From Home" can be started by tuning into Valentine's Detective Agency Radio on your Pip-Boy. This radio station will begin broadcasting after rescuing Valentine and completing the quest Getting a Clue. Alternatively, you can visit the Nakano residence along the northeastern coastline.)</Source>
